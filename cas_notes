    represented as a tree

    basic compute unit is a frac of integers
        rational numbers
        keep irrational numbers (i.e. sqrt(2)) in their form

    imaginary numbers

    limits
        only have one type of limit: lim(var -> \inf)
            can be used to represent irrational constants

wip
    simplify symbolically
        let users define invariants
        let users define complexity for functions / variables (new variables are the sum of their constiuents)
        specify a timeout
        be able to simplify eqn to "$VAR = ..."
            by order of priority:
                minimize occurences of $VAR
                minmize number of terms on same side as $VAR

    how to simplify, for example, sqrt of value?
        fn that converts to multiplication of prime factors
        what if we completley bypass this by only defining primes?

possibilities
    summ/product
        also requires us defining a varible to iterate over...
        problem: discreteness / imaginary numbers
            want to say to do linear interpolation, but what about inf?
                that could work...
                    what about integral from -\inf to \inf?
                        breaks here :(
                start, end, num_steps
                start, inc, num_steps

    have SI units? -> later

    less than, greater than

    approx solve numerically
        specify percent accuracy
            how to make sure everything converges
        calculate decimal from fully defined value
        finite element method (reimann sums, input number of splits)
            for approximating integrals
            https://marksmath.org/visualization/RiemannError/
        finite difference method (euler method, input size of steps)
            for approximating derivatives
        newton method
            for finding zeros
        increase value for finding inf

    tensors
        should be simple enough, just the above with more definitions
